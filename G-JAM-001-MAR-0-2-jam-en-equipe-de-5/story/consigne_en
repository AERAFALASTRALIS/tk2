2786 ... This is the year we discovered that there was a viable planet other than our own in the universe that was also inhabited by an evolved species. She was in the solar system itself in the Milky Way. It was a golden opportunity to be able to trade and connect our two planets.
Unfortunately, when we got there, we noticed that it was in the grip of a shower of asteroids that were going to damage it. So we decided to intervene and come to their aid to prove our peaceful intentions.


All right, here your commander speaking to you, you are going to have to protect planet Earth at all costs, in our interest as well as in theirs. To do this, place your ships between their plasma shields. Protect their shields at all costs because Earth will not withstand such a large asteroid impact.
As for the ship's controls, it's as easy as pie:
If you are player 1, use the Z, Q, S, D keys to move and the SPACE key to shoot.
If you are player 2, use directional arrows to move and RCtrl key to shoot.
You can pause by pressing the ESC key.

Good luck soldier ...
